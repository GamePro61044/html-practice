  <h1>My dogs</h1>
  <h2>These are my dogs!</h2>
  
  <p>Here are their names:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bailey</li>
    <li>Benji</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Bailey is generally the calmer one. He tends to be more well-behaved.</p>
  <p>Benji, on the other hand, is exuberant. He has a hard time knowing when he's not wanted.</p>

  <h3>Their breeds</h3>
  <p>Actually, we're unsure. Bailey is mostly shih tzu. We suspect Benji is primarily Australian shepherd.</p>
